# Project Outline

## Context

In recent years, surface waters have been facing a wave of pollution due mainly to industrial and environmental phenomena. This degradation of water quality constitutes a major challenge for health security and sustainable development.

## Problem

At this moment, every time that scientists need to collect data from the Guiers Lake, they have to thavel there in person and collect data manually. This process is long, difficult, and expensive.

## Proposed Solution

We propose a system designed to collect data from the Guiers Lake in order to help scientist predict water quality level remotely and then avoid time and ressources wasting.

## Objectives
- Full monitoring system to collect water parameters 
- papers for scientific journal or workshop

## Targeted Workshops

We should decide to which one of those workshops we want to submit

| Workshop | URL | Deadline |
|---|---|---|
| Agility with Microservices Programming | https://amp.fe.up.pt/2022/ | ? |
| International Workshop on Smalltalk Technologies | https://esug.github.io/2022-Conference/cfpIWST2022.html | ? |

## Devices

| Name | Description | Price | URL |
|---|---|---|---|
| DS18B20 | Waterproof temperature sensor | €6.99 | https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B01MZG48OE |

## Timeline
