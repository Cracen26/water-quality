# Project Outline

## Problem
The proposed system is designed to collect data from the Guiers Lake in order to help scientist predict water quality level
## Objectives

- full monitoring system
- model to forecasting water params
- papers for scientific journal or workshop

## Targeted Workshops

We should decide to which one of those workshops we want to submit

| Workshop | URL | Deadline |
|---|---|---|
| Agility with Microservices Programming | https://amp.fe.up.pt/2022/ | ? |
