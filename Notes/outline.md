# Project Outline

## Problem
In recent years, surface waters have been facing a wave of pollution due mainly to industrial and environmental phenomena. This degradation of water quality constitutes a major challenge for health security and sustainable development.
The proposed system is designed to collect data from the Guiers Lake in order to help scientist predict water quality level remotely and then avoid time and ressources wasting. 
## Objectives

- full monitoring system
- model to forecasting water params
- papers for scientific journal or workshop

## Targeted Workshops

We should decide to which one of those workshops we want to submit

| Workshop | URL | Deadline |
|---|---|---|
| Agility with Microservices Programming | https://amp.fe.up.pt/2022/ | ? |
| International Workshop on Smalltalk Technologies | https://esug.github.io/2022-Conference/cfpIWST2022.html | ? |
